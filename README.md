# StatGame

### What is this?

This is a game I had toyed around with for a few months.
I wanted to create a game to play around with balancing 
the mechanics so I created this as a 2 player PvP game
where players endevor to fill a stat bar to 100% through
a variaty of modules. For example, in the 1st module the
player can increase the bar by clicking a single button
until the stat bar is full, but they could also click a
different button to balance a meter that increases the bar
automaticly but when the bar is balanced a button has to
be pressed to start the autofill, then their could be a
button that increases the autofill rate but at the cost of
making the meter more likely to tip away from the center
and of course if the meter tips too far the autofill will 
turn off so keeping the meter balanced is imperitive.
I want there to be many modules that operate simlarly to
this, but where each one employsa different method to 
increase the main stat bar and the increasing effect
stacks. The game is about letting the player juggle as 
many of these modules as they can. But only as much as 
they want, so the player can play it safe by only using
two modules that they can easily manage or risk it by 
using 5 or 6 modules that they can lose track of or not
be able to keep up with. I also want different modules 
to have an effect on other modules. For example, there could be a business module
where the player increases the stat bar through the market 
share of a company they arbitrate, and there could be a
stock market module that lets them buy and sell stock and
their company in the other module could be one of the stock 
options. So they could buy a bunch of stock in their own 
company from one module and increase the value of their
company in the other module then sell the stock options 
for value in the main stat bar.
